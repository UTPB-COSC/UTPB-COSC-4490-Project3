# UTPB-COSC-4490-Project3 Christopher Cuevas
This repo contains the assignment and provided code base for Project 3 of the graduate Computational Biomimicry class.

The provided classes (main is in Game.java) contain a very bad implementation of Asteroids in Java. 
Controls:
* Arrow key up - accelerate
* Arrow key left - turn left
* Arrow key right - turn right
* Space bar - shoot
* Esc key - pause/ menu(up and down key to navigate menu, enter key to confirm)

Using the provided engine as a basis, create a game.  The requirements for the game are:
0) All requirements from projects 1&2.
1) At least one form of AI.
2) Either a procedural level generation system or a file-based system for loading level layouts.
3) At least one projectile which interacts with the environment and enemy characters.
4) Some form of procedurally-generated particle effect.
5) (Graduate students only) UDP-based multiplayer mode.

The grading criteria is:
* If the code fails to execute, the grade is zero.
* If the code experiences an unhandled exception in normal play, the grade is zero.
* If the project meets the above requirements, that counts as 100%.
* Partial satisfaction of the requirements will result in a grade between 0 and 100.

Keep in mind that future projects will build upon this one, so as long as your final project meets the above requirements the grade for project 2 will be maximized.
