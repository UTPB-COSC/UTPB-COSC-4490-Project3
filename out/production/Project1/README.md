# UTPB-COSC-4490-Project1
This repo contains the assignment and provided code base for Project 1 of the Introduction to Game Development class.

The provided classes (main is in Game.java) contain a very bad implementation of Flappy Bird in Java.

Using the provided engine as a basis, create *a game*.  The requirements for the game are:
1) There is a failure mode (a game over).
2) At least one user input updates the game state in some way.  Any key or mouse input is valid.
3) The game state is displayed to the user in real time at a rate of at least 30 FPS (on my machine).  The current game state should consist of some number of colored shapes, with one corresponding to the player and two or more (at any given time) corresponding to the valid play area and relevant obstacles to the player.

The grading criteria is:
* If the code fails to execute, the grade is zero.
* If the code experiences an unhandled exception in normal play, the grade is zero.
* If the project meets the above requirements, that counts as 100%.
* Partial satisfaction of the requirements will result in a grade between 0 and 100.

Keep in mind that future projects will build upon this one, so as long as your final project meets the above requirements the grade for project 1 will be maximized.
